# MonteCarloBField
Last version of my heatmap code

Main code: Heatmap_function_ver01

Other codes must be downloaded

** Purpose **: 
- Using spherical harmonic (based on Abel paper) to generate a magnetic field inside the MSR
- Using Munich MSR glms
- Perturb either Fields or positions
- Applying Least Square fit
- Getting back the fit glms
- Make the Fit B by using new glms
- Plot the residual of the True B field â€“ Fit B fields at the true positions
